                creation and application of algorithms built into a dyna

            <h3>Evolution of AI from its inception to the present day</h3>
            <p>The history of artificial intelligence (AI) 
                began in antiquity, with myths, stories and 
                rumors of artificial beings endowed with int
                elligence or consciousness by master craftsm
                en. The seeds of modern AI were planted by ph
                ilosophers who attempted to describe the proc
                ess of human thinking as the mechanical manip
                ulation of symbols. This work culminated in th
                e invention of the programmable digital comput
                er in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstra
                ct essence of mathematical reasoning. This devi
                ce and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of
                scientists to begin seriously discussing the possi
                bility of building an electronic brain.</p>
